        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Ready to use, store-bought chicken stock or broth eliminates one step altogether.</li>
            <li>Rather than adding large pieces of garlic cloves and ginger, mince or chop them finely in a spice grinder. That way you don’t need to worry about straining them out later.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the stock at the same time as the garlic, ginger and spring onions. This will allow the chicken to cook as the the stock is infused with all of the flavors. Once the chicken is cooked (about 20 minutes), you can chop or shred it and add it back to the base, along with mushrooms.</li>
            <li>Steam the greens in the microwave. Spinach only takes 1 minute to steam in the microwave. I add a little oil, garlic and soy sauce and steam in the microwave, and then it’s ready to be used.</li>
            <li>Using instant noodles will cut down on cooking time for the noodles. If I do use instant ramen, I prefer to use NongShim Shin Ramyun ramen packets or Samyang ramen packets. They are thicker and hardy, and stay nice and firm for longer.</li>
            <li>If you’re using dried noodles, you can increase the amount of stock (about 1/3 cup per person), and cook the noodles RIGHT IN THE BROTH too. Keep in mind though, this will make the broth more cloudy because of the released starches. This is why I prefer cooking the ramen separately.</li>
            <li>If you didn’t have time to make the ramen egg earlier, no worries. It only takes about 10 minutes to make an egg, that’s not marinated. Just boil water, and cook the eggs for 6 – 6.5 minutes and then they are ready to eat as soon as they are cool enough to peel. You can boil the eggs while the ramen broth is being prepared.</li>
            <li>If you don’t want to half boil an egg, you can just fry an egg, over easy, and serve it on top of the ramen too!</li>
            <li>You can also use the broth as a base, and top up the ramen with leftover rotisserie chicken (or other leftover meat). This REALLY cuts down on the time!</li>
